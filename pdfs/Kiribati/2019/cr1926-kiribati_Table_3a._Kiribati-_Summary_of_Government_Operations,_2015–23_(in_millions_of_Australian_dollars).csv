Sources: Data provided by the Kiribati authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Projections for the current expenditure for 2017 included the supplementary budget.
2/ Development expenditure equals grants plus loans for development projects.
"3/ Domestic recurrent balance excludes fishing revenue, grants, and capital expenditure."
4/ Overall balance in the table is different from official budget because loans are classified as financing.
5/ The custodial account is government's fund managed by State Street.
6/ The cash account is the government's deposit account at ANZ.
"7/ Balances of RERF, custodial, and cash accounts minus public debt."
8/ Cash reserve buffer includes the custodial account and the cash account.
"9/ In this table, it is assumed that Kiribati will continue to benefit from its grants-only status. This assumption is consistent with MDB's grant"
"decision rules given the DSA rating and even assuming the realization of such grants and their impact on the DSA. On the other hand, in"
"LIC- DSA, for World Bank (IDA) and other MDBs, regular credit terms on all lending is assumed for all years in the projection period for which"
grant finance has not already been committed. This is because the DSA serves to test a country's capacity to take on WB and ADB financing
on credit terms.
