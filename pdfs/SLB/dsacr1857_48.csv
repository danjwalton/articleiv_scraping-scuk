C.           The Way Forward
""
10.    The National Financial Inclusion Strategy 2016–20 (NFIS2) provides a comprehensive
"roadmap for furthering financial inclusion. NFIS2, issued in 2016, seeks to build on the progress"
"made on increasing access, with a greater focus on usage and financial literacy. It aims to add"
"300,000 new users of formal and semi-formal financial services by 2020, of which half is targeted to"
be women. NFIS2 also leverages findings from studies and surveys of demand-side data to
complement readily available supply-side data.
""
11.     NFIS2 identifies five key indicators and six strategic objectives that will be pursued
through broad-based consultation and collaboration. NFIS2 sets five targets to be achieved by
"2020 that address issues of access, usage, credit and financial literacy. It further articulates action"
"plans under six strategic objectives: (i) digital financial services; (ii) micro, small and medium"
enterprises; (iii) inclusion of marginalized groups; (iv) rural households’ financial resilience; (v)
consumer protection; and (vi) stakeholder coordination and leveraging data (Table 2 and Figure 1).
"NFIS2 also spells out the roles of key stakeholders—ministries, non-profits, banks, nonbanks,"
"nonfinancial private sector players, and development partners."
