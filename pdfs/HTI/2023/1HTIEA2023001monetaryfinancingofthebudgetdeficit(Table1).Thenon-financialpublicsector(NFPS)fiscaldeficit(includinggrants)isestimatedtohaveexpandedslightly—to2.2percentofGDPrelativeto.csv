CONTEXT AND RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
1.      Haiti is at a critical juncture. It has been strongly impacted by the spillovers of Russia’s war
"in Ukraine, which heightened the economy’s fragility. While Haiti’s population was already"
"experiencing malnutrition before the war in Ukraine, its suffering has been compounded by the"
"surge in food prices, leading to acute hunger."
""
"2.      Political uncertainty and the security crisis persist. Prime Minister Henry, who has faced"
"several months of widespread protests, has pledged to hold elections as soon as it is safe to do so."
Violence escalated sharply in recent months with internal displacement of thousands of Haitians.
"The security situation constrained economic activity, particularly during September and October,"
hampering efforts to control the recent cholera outbreak.1 The UN Security Council approved a
"sanction regime targeting gang leaders, followed by the Central Bank of Haiti’s instructions to"
financial institutions to support its implementation.
""
"3.        Against this backdrop and a deteriorating global outlook, macroeconomic conditions"
"remain challenging. Real GDP likely contracted for the fourth consecutive year in FY2022, ending in"
"September, by about -1.5 percent. Year-on-year inflation reached 38.7 percent in September"
"2022, driven by high international food and import prices, drought-related supply disruptions, and"
monetary financing of the budget deficit (Table 1). The non-financial public sector (NFPS) fiscal
deficit (including grants) is estimated to have expanded slightly—to 2.2 percent of GDP relative to
1.5 percent envisaged at the time of the SMP approval. This was due to budget strains linked to the
cost of petroleum product subsidies prior to the price increase in September. Despite the riots in
"September, recent data suggest that domestic revenue in FY2022 was 90 percent of the value"
expected in June (Tables 2a and 2b). The current account deficit is estimated at 2.4 percent of GDP
"in FY2022. The gourde and the foreign exchange market came under pressure in the summer, partly"
because of a temporary slowing in remittance inflows that aggravated the shortage of foreign
"exchange. Gross international reserves are still estimated at 4.6 months of projected imports, but net"
"international reserves have declined, by some US$240 million since the end of FY2021."
""
4.       The authorities have nonetheless demonstrated strong commitment under the SMP
and have taken important policy measures. To tackle inflation and prevent further depreciation of
"the gourde, the Banque de la République d’Haïti (BRH) raised short-term interest rates to"
11.5 percent in August (from 10 percent since March 2020); boosted mandatory reserve
"requirements on liabilities, in US dollar terms, to 53 percent; and increased interest rates on credit"
lines. The BRH has moved also to ease loan repayment obligations—extending them for three
months for households and six months for corporates. The authorities have prepared a detailed
"strategy to tackle food insecurity and strengthen the social safety net, leveraging ongoing programs."

 Protests were further inflamed by the government’s announcement on September 14 to raise fuel prices. The
announcement was for the kerosene prices to rise from 353 HTG per gallon to 670 HTG and diesel prices from
"352 HTG per gallon to 665 HTG-a level that would cover costs, margins, and statutory taxes. The price of gasoline"
was announced to be increased from 250 to 570 HTG per gallon-implying a subsidy of 60 HTG per gallon (about
US$0.80 per gallon). These price increases were passed on to consumers at the pump in November.
