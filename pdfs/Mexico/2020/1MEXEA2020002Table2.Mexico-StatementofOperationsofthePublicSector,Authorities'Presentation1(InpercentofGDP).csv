"1/ Data exclude state and local governments, and include state-owned enterprises and public development banks. For 2018 and 2019, the"
"numbers are presented as a percent of aggregated quarterly nominal GDP for consistency with the authorities' presentation, as published in"
2021 General Economic Policy Guidelines.
2/ Includes Bank of Mexico's operating surplus transferred to the federal government for 1.5 percent of GDP in 2017.
3/ Includes social assistance benefits.
4/ Due to lack of disaggregated data this item includes both financing and capital transfers.
5/ The 2014 amendment to the FRL introduced a cap on the real growth rate of structural current spending set at 2.0 percent for 2015 and
"2016, and equal to potential growth thereafter. Structural current spending is defined as total budgetary expenditure, excluding: (i) interest"
payments; (ii) non-programable spending; (iii) cost of fuels for electricity generation; (iv) public sector pensions; (v) direct physical and
financial investment of the federal government; and (vi) expenditure by state productive enterprises and their subsidiaries.
