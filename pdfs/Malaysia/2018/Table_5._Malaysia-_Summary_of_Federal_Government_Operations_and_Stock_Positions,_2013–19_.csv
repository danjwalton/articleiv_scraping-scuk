1/ Authorities' measure of the overall fiscal balance and the IMF's measure of fiscal balance (net lending/borrowing) are different due to differences
in methodology/basis of recording (GFSM2001 versus authorities' modified-cash based accounting) and differences in the treatment of certain items.
"2/ General government includes federal government, state and local governments, and statutory bodies. Public sector includes general government"
and nonfinancial public enterprises (NFPEs).
