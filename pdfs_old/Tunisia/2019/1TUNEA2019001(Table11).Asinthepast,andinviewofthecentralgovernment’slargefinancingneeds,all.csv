PROGRAM ISSUES AND MODALITIES
22.     Staff supports the authorities’ request for waivers of nonobservance of QPCs. The
authorities have taken corrective actions for the missed end-March QPCs on (1) NDA by increasing

"     reforms, and wage restraint will ensure that the overall deficit (before grants) for the year as a"
     whole remains as agreed at the Fourth Review; (2) the floor on social spending would be

"     currency during Ramadan, but would remain consistent with strong monetary tightening over"

     inflows; and (5) the ceilings on net FX interventions would be reduced to support greater
     exchange rate flexibility and reserves accumulation. The monthly IT on net FX interventions
     would be adjusted in line with the quarterly QPC.
