•    The nominal level of new concessional external debt of the central government was well-below
"     the targeted ceiling, consistent with the budget outturn."
""
•    The zero limit on new nonconcessional external debt of the central government was observed.
""
•    The target on net international reserves was met with a wide margin as reserves stood at

"13.     All non-quantitative continuous targets were met throughout the entire program,"
including for the third review. The Government did not impose or intensify restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions nor introduced multiple currency
"practices. Similarly, it did not conclude bilateral payment agreements inconsistent with Article VIII nor"
impose or intensify import restrictions for balance of payments purposes.
""
14.      The Government has continued to make good progress with its structural reform
"agenda, with most targets under the PCI met ahead of schedule, by the time of the second"
"review (Table 2). Under the PCI, the Government has enhanced the monitoring of the financial"
performance of public enterprises through the compilation of financial information on the cash flow
performance and quarterly monitoring of actual performance of the six largest SOEs. All quarterly
"reports were produced on time except the June 2020 report, which was slightly delayed due to the"
lockdown related to the pandemic. Steps have also been taken to streamline tax exemptions on
"customs duties, excises and VAT to enhance revenue performance, and remaining work will be"
"completed later this year: (i) on customs duties, Parliament adopted a law in December 2019"
eliminating all exemptions and introducing a minimum tariff of 5 percent for all previously exempted
"goods; (ii) on excises, the Council of Ministers approved in December 2020, the elimination of"
exemptions on excises. The next step in the implementation of this reform is submission of tax rates
"to Parliament for approval; (iii) on VAT, the streamlining of exemptions will be carried out in the"
"context on the ongoing review of the tax code. In the area of monetary policy, the BCV has"
"strengthened the monetary policy transmission mechanism by narrowing the interest rate corridor,"
"linking the policy rate to key interest rates, and enhancing monetary policy communication. The"
target on the installation of the software system to revamp the public credit registry was met at end-
"December, which will support the Government’s efforts to promote access to finance. However, the"
"completion of a functional central registry of mobile collateral, scheduled for mid-January 2021 is"
now planned for May.
""
"15.       The Government’s broader reform agenda, driven by the PEDS, progressed well during"
the program period (Box 1). Key measures put in place during June 2019-January 2021 aimed to
"improve budgetary processes, restructure and rehabilitate SOEs to support growth and eliminate"
"fiscal risks, enhance regulatory processes and digitalization, improve the business environment,"
strengthen the AML/CFT framework and support financial sector development.
