  Sources: Jamaican authorities and Fund staff estimates and projections.
"  1/ From 2015/16, includes interest receipts from the PetroCaribe Development Fund to reimburse funds from the PetroCaribe debt buyback."
" 2/ Consolidated central government and public bodies' debt, consistent with the Fiscal Responsibility Law. The most significant deviation from the EFF"
 definition is the exclusion of debt to the IMF held by the BoJ.
" 3/ Central government direct debt, guaranteed debt, and debt holdings by PCDF, consistent with the definition used under the EFF approved in 2013"
" 4/ Consistent with the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL), implementation of the FRL-consistent debt definition began in FY16/17."
 A backward series is not available since consistent data on public bodies' debt holdings is not available prior to FY16/17.
 5/ The decrease in debt in FY15/16 partly reflects the PetroCaribe buyback operation that generated an immediate 10 percentage
 point reduction in debt. The increase in debt in FY16/17 partly reflects prefinancing for FY17/18 maturities.
 6/ Includes base wage and backpay.
" 7/ Consistent with the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL), implementation of the FRL-consistent debt definition began in FY16/17."
 A backward series is not available since consistent data on public bodies' debt holdings is not available prior to FY16/17.
 8/ The decline FY18/19 public entities and public sector balances reflects a one-time dividend payment by PetroCaribe to the central government financed
 by a drawdown in PetroCaribe's financial assets. As of FY2019/20 the central government includes PCDF. Compensatory inflows will continue as the
 government gradually unwinds PCDF asset position.
 9/ Gross financing needs include the recapitalization of the central bank for FY2018/19 through FY2020/21.
