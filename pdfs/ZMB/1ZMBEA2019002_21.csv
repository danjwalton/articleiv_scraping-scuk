"       Following a Cabinet meeting in May, the authorities announced a series of measures to"
contain and better control spending. These included indefinitely postponing contraction of new
non-concessional loans; cancelling some committed but undisbursed loans; and increasing control
and management of disbursements on foreign-financed loans.

Authorities’ Views
""
The authorities agreed on the importance of a large front-loaded fiscal adjustment to bring debt
back to a more sustainable path. They acknowledged the need for timely action to control debt
"accumulation and stop arrears buildup, emphasizing the importance of Cabinet-level decisions in this"
regard. The authorities recently announced the halting of disbursement of newly-signed (2018) loan
"agreements. Separately, they noted there could be challenges including on the legal front to pausing"
"ongoing project execution and related disbursements, which would be done in accordance with"
"contract provisions. They highlighted the importance of effective coordination, noting the close"
communication across ministries and with key external lenders. They emphasized the challenges
posed by the large VAT refunds to the mining sector and anticipated that revenue generation will be
helped by the introduction of the sales tax. The authorities viewed the new tax as simpler to
"administer while avoiding the issue of refunds, and noted that similar systems were in place in"
several other countries.
