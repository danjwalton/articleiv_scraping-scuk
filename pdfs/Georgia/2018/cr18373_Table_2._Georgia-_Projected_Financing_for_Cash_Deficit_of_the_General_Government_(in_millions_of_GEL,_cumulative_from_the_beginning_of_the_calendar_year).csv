Ceiling on the Augmented Cash Deficit of the General Government
""
9.     Definition: The augmented cash balance of the general government is defined as: revenues
"minus expense, minus net acquisition of non-financial assets (as defined by GFSM 2001) minus net"
budget lending (as defined below). A negative augmented cash balance is a deficit.
""
10.      The augmented cash balance of the general government will be measured from the financing
"side at current exchange rates established by the NBG at the date of the transaction. Accordingly,"
augmented cash deficit of the general government will be measured by: i) net acquisition of financial
"assets (including changes in balances of the revenue reserve account), excluding net budget lending as"
defined by GFSM 2001; minus ii) net incurrence in domestic and foreign liabilities as defined in GFSM
2001.
""
"11.     Definition: Consistent with GFSM 2001, net budget lending is defined as the net acquisition of"
financial assets for policy purposes by the general government.
""
12.     Adjustor: The ceiling on augmented cash deficit of the general government will be adjusted
upward (higher deficit)/downward (lower deficit) by the cumulative total amount of foreign-financed
"project loan disbursements above/below the program amounts (Table 2), subject to a cap of $60 million"
per year.
""
13.    Adjustor: The ceiling on the augmented cash deficit of the general government will be adjusted
downward (lower deficit) by the cumulative amount of receipts from sale of non-financial assets above
the program amounts (Table 2).
14.    Adjustor: The ceiling on the augmented cash deficit of the general government will be adjusted
upward (higher deficit)/downward (lower deficit) by the amount of VAT credits refunded in cash
above/below the program amounts (Table 2).
