"lowered from 22 percent to 16 percent. The NBE also liberalized some exchange control regulations,"
allowing exporters to access foreign credit and to retain up to 30 percent of their export proceeds in
"foreign currency (previously 10 percent), which, should lessen difficulties in procuring foreign"
exchange when needed for their inputs and capital imports. These measures are intended to address
"the external imbalances by supporting net exports and alleviating foreign exchange shortages, while"
"minimizing potential inflationary effects from the devaluation. Prior to the devaluation, there had"
"been an upward drift in inflation which exceeded the authorities target of about 8 percent, driven by"
food inflation; and significant growth in monetary and credit aggregates in 2016/17 (Figure 2 and
"Table 4). Inflation was 13.6 percent in November 2017, partly reflecting inflation momentum and the"
impact of the devaluation.

"4.      Since October 2016, the authorities appropriately adopted a restrictive stance on both"
government and public enterprises (SOEs) borrowing policies. The 2016/17 general government
"budget deficit was 3.4 percent of GDP including the supplementary budget, slightly below the"
budgeted 3.5 percent of GDP. While expenditure remained unchanged relative to 2015/16 (in
"percent of GDP), revenue underperformed (Table 1) mainly due to a shortfall in import levies. The"
January 2017 supplementary budget (1.1 percent of GDP) allowed for a moderate increase in public
"wages to increase retention, as suggested by a World Bank (WB) study, and social assistance,"
"including drought-related spending. However, the supplementary budget was funded without"
additional borrowing by privatization receipts and fuel price stabilization fund surpluses. Also from
"October 2016, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Cooperation (MOFEC) implemented strong"
"controls on external borrowing by public enterprises. As a result, the NPV of outstanding external"
"obligations stabilized, and non-concessional commercial borrowing was reduced substantially."
