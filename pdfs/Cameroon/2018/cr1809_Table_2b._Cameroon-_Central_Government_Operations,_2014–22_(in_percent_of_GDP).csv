" 1/ Historical and budget figures exclude direct, custom, and VAT taxes due by SONARA which were subject to cross-cancellations against fuel subsidies due to SONARA (i.e., the revenue is presented on a net basis)."
" From 2016 onward, projections for these taxes are made on a gross basis."
" 2/ The payment of float and past unpaid obligations was included in individual expenditure lines prior to 2016. From 2016 onward, fiscal data report payment orders for the current fiscal year; payments of the float and"
 unpaid obligations are recorded between the overall deficit on a payment order basis and the overall balance on a cash basis.
 3/ Include adjustment for payment orders issued in 2016 for investment to be executed in 2017 and 2018.
" 4/ The CEMAC reference fiscal balance is calculated as the overall fiscal balance minus the savings from oil revenue, which is the sum of 20 percent of oil revenue of the current year and 80 percent of the oil revenuye in"
 excess of the average oil revenues in the previous three years.
