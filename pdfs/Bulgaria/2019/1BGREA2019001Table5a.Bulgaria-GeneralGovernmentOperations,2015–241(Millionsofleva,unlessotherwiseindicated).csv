1/ On cash basis.
"2/ Includes dividends. For 2019, includes the Sofia Airport concession revenue BGN 660 million, which will be transferred to the state-owned railway company BDZ"
and included in capital expenditure. The amendment to the Energy Act of 01.07.2018 changes the mechanism for raising revenue and executing expenditure toward
"electricity producers through the budget of the EPSF. That leads to an increase of the non-tax revenue, and the subsidy expenditure respectively. The impact on the"
"budget balance is neutral, as the revenue and expenditure are increased with the same amount."
"3/ Includes other remuneration since 2014, which were previously integrated in use of goods and services."
"4/ From 2014, with the adoption of the Public Finance Act, other remunerations are re-classified to the compensation of employees."
"5/ Since July 2018, includes expenditure of the Electricity Power Security Fund."
6/ Contribution to EU budget.
"7/ Includes only acquisitions of nonfinancial assets, i.e., capital expenditure. For 2019, includes concession revenue BGN 660 million for the Sofia Airport."
