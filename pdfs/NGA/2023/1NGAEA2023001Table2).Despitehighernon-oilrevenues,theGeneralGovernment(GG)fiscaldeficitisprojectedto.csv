"9.      The near-term outlook faces downside risks, while there are upside risks in the"
medium term (Annex I). Higher international food and fertilizer prices and continued widening of
the parallel market premium could cause high inflation to persist longer or inflation expectations to
"be de-anchored, with adverse effects on food prices (Figure 7). The oil sector faces downside risks"
"from possible production and price volatility, while climate-related natural disasters (e.g., floods)"
pose downside risks to agriculture. A synchronized monetary policy tightening across advanced
"economies also poses a downside risk, which could increase debt servicing costs. In the medium"
"term, there are upside risks from a stronger reform momentum by the new government, a larger"
"rebound in oil and gas production, and the Dangote refinery reaching its full potential more rapidly"
than assumed in the baseline. 4

Authorities’ Views

10.      The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s growth and inflation outlook while being
more optimistic on oil production. The CBN predicts a slightly higher growth rate of 3.3 percent
for 2023 while the Ministry of Finance’s forecast is significantly stronger at 3.75 percent. The
authorities’ more optimistic growth outlook in 2023 and in the medium term is driven by a more
"positive assessment of oil production prospects. On headline CPI inflation, they project an average"
"rate of around 17-18 percent for 2023, similar to staff’s projection of 17.4 percent, falling further in"
the medium term.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Ensuring macroeconomic stability will require tightening across all policy levers: stronger revenue
"mobilization and fuel subsidy reforms to create much-needed fiscal space, decisive monetary policy"
"tightening to head off inflation drifts, and exchange rate adjustment to quell FX shortages and capital"
outflows. Lower adjustment in one area implies that the burden would fall more acutely on the rest—
particularly on the fiscal side if the policy mix remains unsustainable. Staff’s proposal is calibrated to
avoid unduly one-sided adjustments. Tighter macroeconomic policies should be complemented by
"structural reforms to improve governance, reduce corruption vulnerabilities, create jobs, and increase"
social cohesion.
A. Fiscal Policy: Rejuvenate Critical Fiscal Reforms
""
"11.     Under staff’s baseline projections, fiscal deficits are expected to stay elevated (Text"
"Table 2). Despite higher non-oil revenues, the General Government (GG) fiscal deficit is projected to"
"widen to 6.2 percent of GDP in 2022, mainly due to the fuel subsidy costs. Over the medium term,"
oil revenues are projected to steadily decline reflecting price moderation and continued fuel
subsidies pending a decision from the incoming government. Overall fiscal deficits remain elevated

"  The Dangote refinery expects to start production in 2023 and reach full capacity of 650,000 bpd by end-2024."
"Staff’s baseline projections assume a more gradual production path: 100,000 bpd in 2024, 200,000 bpd in 2025, rising"
"to 300,000 bpd during 2026-27. The impact on the CA is expected to be limited, mostly in the form of savings in"
"transportation costs, as lower imports are, to a large extent, countered by lower crude exports as the refinery is"
expected to purchase crude oil locally.
