"1/ The 2015 other revenue includes infrastructure tax credit, recoveries from former years (mainly fees and charges) and asset sale."
"2/ Withdrawals from the Stabilization Fund (mining and petroleum taxes; mining, petroleum and gas dividends.)"
3/ As the authorities integrated the recurrent and development budgets from 2014 there is a discontinuity in the classification.
"4/ Grants include spending on wages and salaries, goods and services, and capital expenditure."
5/ Discrepancies between the overall balance and financing arise because of data coverage gaps in revenue and expenditure
"extrabudgetary units, and payment arrears and cash withdrawals from trust accounts which are not fully accounted for due to data weaknesses."
6/ Contingent liabilities include future unfunded superannuation liabilities with Nambawan Super and SOE
