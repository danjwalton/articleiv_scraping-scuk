Sources: Nauru authorities and IMF staff estimates and projections.
"1/ Under the baseline scenario, current policies would deplete government deposits by FY2023 and require borrowing of around 2.1 months of non-RPC spending in FY2024. With the expected yield from"
"measures, the borrowing is avoided and the government deposit target of 2 months of non-RPC current spending achieved."

 17.      Further tax reform is an opportunity to generate revenue more efficiently. Increased
 domestic tax revenue will be needed to offset lost customs revenue from Nauru’s ratification of the
 Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus (PACER Plus) and loss of revenue from a scaling
" down in RPC activity. 3 The focus on introducing a consumption tax in the near term is appropriate,"
 but for the reform to yield expected results it requires careful design (including choice of tax base
" and rate structure), sequencing and timing of implementation, as well as modernization of the tax"
 administration. Staff recommends setting tax reform in a comprehensive medium-term revenue
 strategy to coordinate broad based reforms. The IMF is available to provide advice through PFTAC.
" As most Nauru citizens do not have experience of paying tax, policy changes will require careful"
 communication to engender taxpayer compliance.

 18.     Improved public financial management (PFM) is needed to improve fiscal discipline
" and the quality of spending, based on the PFM roadmap. The authorities are working to address"
" the issues identified during the 2016 PEFA assessment, following their PFM roadmap. Good progress"
" has been made towards improvement in transparency, with the online availability of budget"
" statements (see also paragraph 32). Staff encourages continued focus on PFM reform, given"
 weaknesses remaining to be addressed. Staff recommends:
