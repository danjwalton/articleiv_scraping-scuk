" 1/ The coverage of this table has been expanded to fully reflect all general government financing operations. However, data are on a"
" non-consolidated basis (with intra-government flows presented where available). On a consolidated basis, they are smaller, by the"
 amount of intra-government transactions.
" 2/ For projection years, all t-bills issuance is assumed to be short term (i.e. at maturities of 12 months or below)."
" 3/ For EFSF loans, outstanding loans are assumed to be rolled over for an additional 7 years, as agreed with the EU."
" 4/ Includes net financing from retail government securities programs, as well as adjustments for cash-accrual differences and"
 consistency between annual projections and preliminary quarterly accounts.
 5/ Changes in government deposits.
