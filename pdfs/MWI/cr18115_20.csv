         The authorities are committed to improving the fiscal position in the remainder of FY
2017/18. They cut spending by about 1 percent of GDP in the last four months of this fiscal year —
mainly in domestically financed development (to reflect implementation capacity) and goods and
"services. Nevertheless, the primary balance is projected to deteriorate from -0.6 percent of GDP in"
2016/17 to -3.0 percent of GDP in 2017/18. Any arrears (from FY 2012/13 to FY 2016/17) that have
not already been cleared are anticipated to be fully cleared by end-June 2018 through securitization.
"To avoid accumulation of new arrears, the authorities tightened commitment controls and"
established a system tracking the stock of commitments (MEFP ¶4). The deficit (including payment
of arrears-related securities) has been financed by both foreign and domestic financing – including
MK69 billion (1.7 percent of GDP) of RBM financing which was undertaken in the first half of the
"fiscal year, prior to program discussions. During the second half of the fiscal year, there will be no"
additional RBM financing.
