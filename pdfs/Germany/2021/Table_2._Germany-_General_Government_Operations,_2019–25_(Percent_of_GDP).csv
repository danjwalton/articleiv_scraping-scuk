Authorities’ Views
""
28.     The authorities emphasized that their policies have been closely calibrated to the
"progress of the pandemic, and that they stand ready to deploy additional measures if"
"needed. The policy mix evolved throughout the pandemic, from the expansion of the safety net in"
"the March rescue package, to the June stimulus program supporting broad-based recovery, and"
then to the aid package targeting the most affected businesses during the renewed lockdown. The
authorities stressed the importance of their measures in supporting private sector confidence in this
"highly uncertain environment. They remain vigilant for any further signs of economic distress, and"
"are ready to step up support if needed. However, they did not identify a current need for a further"
"extension of the assessment basis for the R&D tax allowance, as it was just lately doubled from"
€2 million to €4 million (the arrangement is in place until end-June 2026). An evaluation is to be
"undertaken in 2025. Moreover, the returns to further increasing the threshold may not be very"
"substantial, since large firms already receive compensation for R&D through other government"
programs. The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment that public debt is sustainable under all
reasonable stress scenarios and that fiscal space remains available for additional support.
""
29.     The authorities highlighted the transformational nature of several of their recent
"measures, which are expected to support structural changes after the pandemic. The “future"
"package” in the June stimulus program allocated €26.2 billion to the Energy and Climate Fund, a"
special reserve for implementing the government’s climate policies; €1 billion to support digital
"learning in schools; and €5 billion on 5G infrastructure. In addition, the medium-term budget plan"
continues to be guided by the government’s policy priority: promoting climate-friendly and inclusive
growth.
