1/ Fiscal year values (July-June). Includes Covid-related fiscal measures starting in FY2020/21.
2/ Sale of fixed capital assets included in nontax revenue rather than under expenditure.
"3/ Starting with FY2022/23, grants includes project grants from the US and the EU. Grants averaged 17.7 percent of GDP per year during 2010-14, before the 2015"
political crisis. Projected World Bank grants account for most of projected grants during 2022-23 and about half of the grants during 2024-27. No World Bank grant
is assumed after 2027.
"4/ Includes the grant for the IMF debt service falling due from October 16, 2021 to April 13, 2022, which is subject to the availability of resources under the CCRT."
5/ Includes unforeseen spending and spending not properly classified due to lack of proper reconciliation between the Ministry in charge of Finance and the Central
Bank. Covid spending envisaged in the FY2021/22 budget (BIF 70.4 billion or 1.07 percent of GDP) is not itemized in the budget but is included in some current and
investment spending lines such as transfers to hospitals.
6/ The strong increase in investment during FY2022/23 is due to a jump in domestic investment financed with part of the SDR allocation and project financing as per
footnote 3.
7/ A negative sign denotes a reduction of financial assets.
""
8/ Staff projects that the central bank will on-lend in local currency to the government the equivalent of half of the SDR allocation in FY2022/23 (2.6 percent of GDP)
and the remainder in FY2023/24 and FY2024/25.
