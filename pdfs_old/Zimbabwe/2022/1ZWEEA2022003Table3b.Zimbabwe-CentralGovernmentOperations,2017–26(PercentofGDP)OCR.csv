‘ Capital transfers historically include transfers to SOES’s as well as spending related to off-budget support programs and RBZ quasi-fiscal activities for which details are unclear.
Projections assume on-budget spending.
* The difference between the fiscal balance on a commitment and cash basis is the change in domestic and foreign interest arrears.
> Accumulated arrears on foreign debt do not include valuation adjustment. The stock of arrears could differ from that in the balance of payments table.
* A negative (positive) number means that Financing is lower (higher) than the Overall Balance on commitment basis.
"= Includes SDR spending and financing of 1.0 percent of GDP and 0.5 percent of GDP in 2021 and 2022, respectively."
