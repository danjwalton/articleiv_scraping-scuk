Primary balance shock               Minimum shock equivalent to 50% of planned adjustment (50%                       1.8

Real GDP growth shock               Real GDP growth is reduced by 1 standard deviation for 2 consecutive             3.5
                                    years; revenue-to-GDP ratio remains the same as in the baseline; level
                                    of non-interest expenditures is the same as in the baseline;
                                    deterioration in primary balance lead to higher interest rate (see
                                    above); decline in growth leads to lower inflation (0.25 percentage
                                    points per 1 percentage point decrease in GDP growth).

Interest rate shock                 Interest rate increases by difference between average real interest rate         1.8

Exchange rate shock                 Estimate of overvaluation or maximum historical movement of the                  -0.5
