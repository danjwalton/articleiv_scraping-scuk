     1
"      For FY2020, an estimated 25 million (2.2 percent of GDP) of spending is related to the COVID-19. For FY2021, an estimated 70 million (6.4"
"     percent of GDP) of spending is related to the pandemic. The amounts are added to the spending on goods and services, as disaggregated"
     information is not available.
     2
"      SDR 6.9 million, equivalent to 50 percent of Tonga's quota."
     3
      Projections assume a decline in grants over the medium-term once current commitments are fully disbursed; decline in revenue during 2021
"     due to tax exemptions, deferrals, or arrears as a result of the pandemic; improvements in revenue collection (CT, CIT and PIT) due to ongoing"
     improvements in revenue administration and the expiration of tax exemptions; and improved collection of property-related revenues. On
"     spending, the projections assume an increase in pandemic related spending in 2021 due to containment, healthcare and social assistance. Over"
"     the medium term, the projections assume ongoing efforts to control spending especially on wages, and better accounting of the wage bill"
"     which, starting in FY2021, no longer includes wage estimates for persistently unfilled vacancies. Investment forecasts include current plans for"
"     donor-funded projects for development and climate-resilience goals, but some are likely to be delayed to subsequent years due to the"
     pandemic. The 2020 IMF-World Bank Climate Change Policy Assessment spending estimates to achieve climate- and sustainable development
     goals are included in the forecasts based on staff assessments of implementation capacity.
