PUBLIC DEBT COVERAGE
1.       The DSA includes public and publicly guaranteed external and domestic debt. Public
and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt comprises external and domestic debt in a fairly comprehensive
"manner, including: all external liabilities held by the central bank; all borrowing from the IMF; non-"
guaranteed domestic debts owed by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in cases where the government
"has at least 50 percent of the shares (e.g., JIRAMA and Air Madagascar);3 domestic arrears (which are"
small at about 0.2 percent of GDP4); and direct guarantees provided by the central government (Text
Table 1). Borrowing by local governments requires the authorization from the Ministr y of Finance
and no request for such authorization has been submitted to date. The measure of debt is on a
gross basis and the currency criterion is used to distinguish between domestic and external debt. 5
The authorities publish data on a quarterly basis on both domestic and external debt. Reporting of
"debt statistics on public enterprises needs to be strengthened further , particularly by: (i) requiring all"
public enterprises to submit financial statements to the Ministry of Finance within legal limits; (ii)
compiling information about public enterprises including debt statistics and monitoring -related
risks; and (iii) publishing this information online in budget documents and fiscal risk statements .

"2.      Notwithstanding the comprehensive coverage of debt statistics, a contingent liability"
shock of 7.6 percent of GDP is simulated to account for potential liabilities. This reflects the
default setting for PPPs and financial markets and a country-specific calibration for possible
additional SOE liabilities (Text Table 2).

• While estimated domestic debt for SOEs in which the government has a majority stake is
"incorporated in the baseline (i.e., debt of 2.2 percent of GDP for JIRAMA and of 2.2 percent for other"
"SOEs),6 government recognition of some SOE short-term liabilities could also materialize (e.g., if"
large exchange rate fluctuations require that the government offers assistance in paying external

"3 Although legislation allows it, public enterprises do not hold direct external non-guaranteed debt."

  These arrears do not trigger an “in distress”-rating given their domestic nature.

  Locally issued debt denominated in local currency held by non-residents and locally issued debt denominated in
"foreign currency held by residents are insignificant, meaning that results would be similar if done on a residency"
basis.
"6 While JIRAMA is working with the World Bank on the implementation of its recovery plan, to be conservative, we do"
""
not account for the potential benefits of this plan on the domestic debt forecast owing to its long horizon. In
"particular, we assume that JIRAMA’s debts remain at the same ratio to GDP through the entire forecast horizon"
"(2.3 percent of GDP). This implies that successful implementation of the plan is an upside risk for the baseline, while"
non-implementation of the plan could result in still-high arrears and larger projected operational transfers .
