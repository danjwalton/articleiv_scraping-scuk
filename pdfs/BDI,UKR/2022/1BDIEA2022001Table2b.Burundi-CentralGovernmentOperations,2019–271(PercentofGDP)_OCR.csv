Sources: Burundi authorities; and IMF staff estimates and projections.
1/ Fiscal year values Jluly-June). Includes Covid-related fiscal measures starting in F¥2020/21.
2/ Sale of fixed capital assets included in nontax revenue rather than under expenditure.
"3/ Starting with FY¥2022/23, grants includes project grants from the US and the EU. Grants averaged 17.7 percent of GDP per year during 2010-14, before the"
2015 political crisis. Projected World Bank grants account for most of projected grants during 2022-23 and about half of the grants during 2024-27. No World
Bank grant is assumed after 2027.
"4/ Includes the grant for the IMF debt service falling due from October 16, 2021 to April 13, 2022, which is subject to the availability of resources under the"
CCRT.
5/ Includes unforeseen spending and spending not properly classified due to lack of proper reconciliation between the Ministry in charge of Finance and the
Central Bank. Covid spending envisaged in the FY¥Y2021/22 budget (BIF 70.4 billion or about 1 percent of GDP) is not ttemized in the budget but is included in
some current and investment spending lines such as transfers to hospitals.
6/ The strong increase in investment during FY¥2022/23 is due to a jump in domestic investment financed with part of the SDR allocation and project financing
as per footnote 3.
7/ A negative sign denotes a reduction of financial assets.
8/ Staff projects that the central bank will on-lend in local currency to the government the equivalent of half of the SDR allocation in F¥2022/23 (2.6 percent of
"GDP) and the remainder in F¥2023/24 and FY2024/25,"
