" 1/ The 2015 other revenue includes infrastructure tax credit, recoveries from former years (mainly fees and charges) and asset sale."
" 2/ Withdrawals from the Stabilization Fund (mining and petroleum taxes; mining, petroleum and gas dividends.)"
 3/ As the authorities integrated the recurrent and development budgets from 2014 there is a discontinuity in the classification.
" 4/ Grants include spending on wages and salaries, goods and services, and capital expenditure."
 5/ Discrepancies between the overall balance and financing arise because of data coverage gaps in revenue and expenditure for
" extrabudgetary units, and payment arrears and cash withdrawals from trust accounts which are not fully accounted for due to data weaknesses."
 6/ Contingent liabilities include future unfunded superannuation liabilities with Nambawan Super and SOE borrowing.
