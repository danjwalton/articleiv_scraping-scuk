" 2/ Withdrawals from the Stabilization Fund (mining and petroleum taxes; mining, petroleum and gas dividends.)"
 3/ As the authorities integrated the recurrent and development budgets from 2014 there is a discontinuity in the classification.
" 4/ Grants include spending on wages and salaries, goods and services, and capital expenditure."
 5/ Discrepancies between the overall balance and financing arise because of data coverage gaps in revenue and expenditure
" extrabudgetary units, and payment arrears and cash withdrawals from trust accounts which are not fully accounted for due to data weaknesses."
