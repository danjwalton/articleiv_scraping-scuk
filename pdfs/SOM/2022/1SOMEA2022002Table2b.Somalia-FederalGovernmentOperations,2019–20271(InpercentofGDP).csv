"     1/ Fiscal operations are recorded on a cash basis. Positions shown are cumulative year to date. For 2020 and 2021, ""ECF Prog."" and ""Budget"" are based on GDP before rebasing."
     2/ Includes only donor support provided to the federal government through treasury accounts at the Central Bank of Somalia. A change in World Bank policy for countries with moderate
"     risk of debt distress that replaces the previous 50:50 mix of grants and loans with 100 percent loans (with 50-year maturity), will impact Somalia starting in 2024 because after reaching"
"     HIPC Completion Point in 2023, Somalia would be assessed as having a moderate risk of debt distress."
""
"     3/ Advances and transfers to Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), and grants to other organizations not expensed are not included."
     4/The increase in 2020 reflects a reallocation of allowances from goods and services to compensation of employees in the context of Somlia National Army reform.
"     5/ Public debt stock reported herein assumes debt relief through the HIPC Initiative, MDRI, and beyond HIPC at Completion Point, which is assumed for 2023 (consistent with DSA's"
     altenative scenario).
     6/ Consistent with the public debt definition in the DSA. It includes net SDR position of the FGS.
"     7/ The figure includes only wages, salaries, and allowances."
"     8/ The authorities decided to distribute the 2021 SDR Allocation by the IMF on August 23, 2021 for SDR156.6 million (about US$ 222.13 million) between the CBS (about US$ 90 million)"
     and the FGS (about US$ 133 million).
"     9/ The figure includes all cash balances, including fiscal buffer and projects."
