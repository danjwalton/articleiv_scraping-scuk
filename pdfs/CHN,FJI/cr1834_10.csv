environment improves and bottlenecks to
private sector development are gradually removed:

"•   Real GDP growth is projected to reach 3.5 percent in 2018, supported by the normalization of"
"    production in the agriculture sector, the reconstruction activities, and a buoyant tourism sector"
    underpinned by the strong growth momentum of the global economy. Growth is expected to be
"    around 3–3.5 percent in the medium-term, in line with estimates of potential growth"
    (Table 5 and Box 2).
"•   Inflation pressures are expected to increase following increases in excise taxes, public wages,"
"    and oil prices. Inflation is projected to average 3.3 percent in 2018, and converge to 3 percent in"
    the medium term (Table 5).
"•   The current account deficit is projected to remain elevated, close to 5 percent of GDP, in"
    2017-18 due to higher reconstruction-related imports. It will then gradually decline to
    3.5 percent of GDP as the impact of Winston on external accounts wanes (Table 4).
•   Fiscal policy will be supportive during fiscal year 2017–18 as the rebuilding of public
    infrastructure is still ongoing. The fiscal deficit is projected to increase to 4.5 percent of GDP in
    fiscal year 2017-18 and then decline to 2.5–3 percent as capital expenditure normalizes (Text
    Table 3). The public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase in fiscal year 2017–18 to finance
    the temporarily higher fiscal deficit and to decline slowly after that (Text Table 3 and Annex II).
•   Monetary and financial conditions are projected to gradually tighten as the recovery becomes
    firm and underlying inflation picks up. Credit to the private sector is projected to gradually slow
    down and grow in line with nominal GDP (Table 5).
