"     The original program for 2018 includes FCFA 42 billion (1.4 percent of GDP) of projected cost for the recapitalization of the two merged state owned banks, which is"
 no longer reflected in the current projections as the government is re-launching their privatization.
 2
     Arrears accumulations were rolled over in 2016 using 2016 revenues.
 3
     2018 figures include an adjustor for arrears payment of CFAF 59.3 billion (2 percent of GDP).
 4
     Data on capital expenditure and financing in 2015-16 are staff estimates to reflect pre-financing agreements with private companies. Staff has not been able to create fully
" consistent estimates, which explains the gap in 2015-16."
