1/ The output gap used for the structural adjustment calculation is measured as the difference between staff's real GDP and the potential GDP of the committee of
"experts for years for which it is available and binding. Beyond those years, the output gap is progressively closed over time taking into account staff’s assessment of the"
state of the economy.
2/ The Fiscal Impulse is defined as the negative of the annual change of the structural non-mining primary balance.
"3/ Includes liabilities of the central government, the cental bank of Chile and non-financial public enterprises. Excludes Recognition Bonds."
