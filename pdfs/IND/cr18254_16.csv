KEY POLICY ISSUES
"12.     Policy mix. With limited policy space, growing risks (which places a premium on prudent"
"policies), and the economy recovering, India would be served best by stepping up supply-side"
measures to revive credit growth (including to businesses) and promote inclusive growth. Fiscal
consolidation should continue to lower elevated public debt levels and allow for easing of financial
"repression. The RBI will need to gradually tighten policy further, in response to inflation pressures,"
which will help to build monetary policy credibility. The staff’s advice on financial sector reforms is
anchored by the recommendations made in the recent FSAP (Appendix III).
""
13.     Macro-financial and structural policies are medium-term priorities to boost inclusive
growth and harness the demographic dividend. Immediate priorities are to revive bank credit and
enhance the efficiency of credit provision by accelerating the cleanup of bank and corporate balance
sheets and a decisive strengthening of PSB governance. Gains can also be made by simplifying and
"streamlining the GST structure and broadening the tax base. More broadly, over the longer term,"
"greater labor market flexibility, land reforms, and product market liberalization are needed."
