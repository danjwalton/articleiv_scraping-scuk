"14.      Under current policies, fiscal buffers would not be rebuilt, putting the debt position"
at risk. In the baseline scenario (Text Table 2) staff projects that the fiscal deficit will decline
"gradually to 2.9 percent of GDP by 2022-23, but public debt will remain broadly constant at"
"51 percent of GDP. In the event of a large natural disaster, the associated fiscal cost could imply a"
jump in the level of public debt that could be difficult to sustain (Annex 5).

15.      Staff recommends a more ambitious medium-term fiscal consolidation strategy
compared with the authorities’ current plan. In staff’s preferred scenario (Text Table 3) the
fiscal deficit reaches
