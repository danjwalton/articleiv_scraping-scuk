Sources: Somali authorities; and IMF Staff estimates and projections.
1/ Fiscal operations are recorded on a cash basis. Positions shown are cumulative year to date.
2/ Includes only donor support provided to the federal government through treasury accounts at the Central Bank of Somalia. A change in World Bank policy for countries with moderate risk of debt distress that replaces the
"previous 50:50 mix of grants and loans with 100 percent loans (with 50-year maturity), will impact Somalia starting in 2024 because after reaching HIPC Completion Point in 2023, Somalia would be assessed as having a"
moderate risk of debt distress.
"3/ Advances and transfers to Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), and grants to other organizations not expensed are not included."
4/The increase in 2020 reflects a reallocation of allowances from goods and services to compensation of employees in the context of Somlia National Army reform.
"5/ Debt stock reported herein assumes debt relief through the HIPC Initiative, MDRI, and beyond HIPC at Completion Point, which is assumed for 2023 (consistent with DSA's altenative scenario)."
6/ Consistent with the public debt definition in the DSA. It includes net SDR position of the FGS.
"7/ The figure includes only wages, salaries, and allowances."
"8/ The authorities decided to distribute the 2021 SDR Allocation by the IMF on August 23, 2021 for SDR156.6 million (about US$ 222.13 million) between the CBS (about US$ 90 million) and the FGS (about US$132"
million).
"9/ The figure includes all cash balances, including fiscal buffer and projects."
