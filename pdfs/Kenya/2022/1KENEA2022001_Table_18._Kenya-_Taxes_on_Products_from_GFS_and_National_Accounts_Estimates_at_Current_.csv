"deductible VAT, the total tax collected was derived from the product flow and was allocated to"
SUT products based on the known tax rates for each product (that is either 16.0 percent or zero)
multiplied by the taxable demand estimated from the SUT itself. The average rate applicable to
"each product was less than the prescribed rate of 16.0 percent, rather the effective rate was"
slightly above 14 percent for products on which VAT is charged. This is consistent with the
"observation that some sales will not be captured within the VAT system, leading to what is"
known as the ‘tax gap.’

"51.     Although, the methodology for allocating the tax on products is reasonable, in"
"order to be consistent with the GFS, the mission recommends that the actual tax collected from"
the public accounts should be used as a benchmark rather than being derived through the
product flow calculation and the trade records.
""
52.     The table below provides a comparison of the tax collected and the tax reported by
the general government including the implied tax derived from the product flow and
"custom records. In terms of VAT, the differences are significant, and the NA estimates are"
"greater by over 20 percent. Similarly, a large difference is reported with the VAT collected by the"
government and the one implied from the SUT.
