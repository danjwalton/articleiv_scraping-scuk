Sources: Burundi authorities; and IMF staff estimates and projections.
1/ Fiscal year values (July-June). Includes Covid-related fiscal measures starting in FY2020/21.
2/ Sale of fixed capital assets included in nontax revenue rather than under expenditure.
"3/ Includes the grant for the IMF debt service falling due from October 16, 2021 to April 13, 2022, which is subject to the availability of resources"
   under the CCRT.
4/ Includes unforeseen spending and spending not properly classified due to lack of proper reconciliation between the Ministry in charge of Finance and
 the Central Bank. Covid spending envisaged in the FY2021/22 budget (BIF 70.4 billion or 1.07 percent of GDP) is not itemized in the budget but is
 included in some current and investment spending lines such as transfers to hospitals.
5/ A negative sign denotes a reduction of financial assets.
