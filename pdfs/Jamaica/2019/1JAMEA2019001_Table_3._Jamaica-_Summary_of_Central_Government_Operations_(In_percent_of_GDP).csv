      definition is the exclusion of debt to the IMF held by the BoJ.

     available since consistent data on public bodies' debt holdings is not available prior to FY16/17.
      5/ The decrease in debt in FY15/16 partly reflects the PetroCaribe buyback operation that generated an immediate 10 percentage
     point reduction in debt. The increase in debt in FY16/17 partly reflects prefinancing for FY17/18 maturities.

      backward series is not available since consistent data on public bodies' debt holdings is not available prior to FY16/17.
      8/ The decline FY18/19 public entities and public sector balances reflects a one-time dividend payment by PetroCaribe to the central government financed
     by a drawdown in PetroCaribe's financial assets. As of FY2019/20 the central government includes PCDF. Compensatory inflows will continue as the
     government gradually unwinds PCDF asset position.
