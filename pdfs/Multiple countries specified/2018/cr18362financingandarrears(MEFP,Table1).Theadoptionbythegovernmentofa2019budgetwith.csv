                                                Note: Estimates of control of corruption are derived from perceptions-based
                                                data. A 90 percent confidence interval around the point estimate for Togo
                                                would cover a range of -0.77 to -1.29 in 2013 and -0.48 to -0.93 in 2017.
                                                Confidence intervals for peer group averages are negligible.

PROGRAM MODALITIES AND OTHER ISSUES
"28.     The program will continue to be reviewed based on quantitative performance criteria,"
"indicative targets, and structural benchmarks at end-December 2018 and end-June and end-"
"September 2019. At end-December 2018, the adjustment of the QPC on net domestic financing for"
"arrears repayments is proposed to be removed. Instead, an indicative target on net domestic arrears"
"accumulation is proposed; this approach allows for a closer monitoring, distinguishing domestic"
"financing and arrears (MEFP, Table 1). The adoption by the government of a 2019 budget with"
expenditure in line with the ECF-supported program is a prior action for the completion of the third
"ECF review, as is the drafting of the terms-of-reference for the auditor that will assess the economic"
"value of the larger bank. These prior actions have been met. More generally, the privatization"
"process for the two banks is monitored by several structural benchmarks (for end-December 2018,"
"end-April 2019, and end-August 2019). The end-September 2018 structural benchmark on public"
investment is proposed to be redesigned and reset to end-December 2018. The fourth review of the
program will be based on the end-December 2018 criteria/targets/benchmarks and is scheduled to
"be discussed by the IMF Board on or after March 15, 2019. The program is financed with support"
"from development partners including the World Bank, the European Union, and the African"
"Development Bank and others, while ECF disbursements will close the remaining financing needs."

"29.     Safeguards assessment: An updated safeguards assessment of the BCEAO, completed in"
"April 2018, found that the central bank has maintained a strong control environment since the last"
"assessment in 2013 and its governance arrangements are broadly appropriate. In addition, audit"
"arrangements have been strengthened, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) were"
"adopted as the accounting framework beginning with the 2015 financial statements, and a 2016"
external quality review of the internal audit function found broad conformity with international
standards. The BCEAO’s risk management framework established in 2014 is also progressing well
with implementation of its work across the bank.
