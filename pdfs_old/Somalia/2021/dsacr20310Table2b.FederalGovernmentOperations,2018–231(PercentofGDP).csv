Sources: Somali authorities; and Fund staff estimates and projections.
1/ Fiscal operations are recorded on a cash basis. Positions shown are cumulative year to date.
2/ Includes only donor support provided to the federal government through treasury accounts at the Central Bank of Somalia.
3/ Bilateral grants revenue for 2017 includes US$50 million later transferred to create Government deposits held abroad.
"4/ Advances and transfers to MDAs, and grants to other organizations not expensed are not included."
5/ Increase in compensation of employees in 2017 reflects bringing onto budget military spending related to the loss of an off-budget grant. The increase
in 2020 reflects a reallocation of allowances from G&S to compensation in the context of SNA reform.
6/ Other expenses line reflects contingent expense items that will only be incurred once relevant donor grants materialize (grant recorded under
multilateral grants)
"7/ The figure includes only wages, salaries, and allowances."
8/ Includes resources in the formal fiscal buffer which is available to meet priority expenditure needs in the event of a shortfall in revenue. Goal is to
"maintain a minimum of 1-month total FGS compensation plus food component for the Somalia National Army, consistent with the guidelines on the use of"
the fiscal buffer.
