1/ Energy subsidies used to be accounted as expenses net of revenue streams from utilities and fuel companies. The series has been revised to report gross flows of
revenues from the commercialization of fuel of Entreprise Tunisienne d’Activités Pétrolières (ETAP) and from operational surplus of Société Tunisienne des Industries de
"Raffinage (STIR). Revenues beyond 2016 are not forecasted. A smoothing fuel mechanism is expected to be implemented on July 1, 2017, to bridge the gap between"
domestic and international prices; surplus dividends linked to this mechanism are not expected.
"2/ End-period difference between the cash and accrual central government overall deficit. Actuals also include payments for which payment has been ordered, but the"
corresponding amounts have not been withdrawn from the treasury accounts yet. A negative sign implies higher cash spending than ordered (i.e. higher required
financing).
3/ Includes mostly the sale of confiscated assets.
4/ Social spending includes social transfers and programs as well as key ministries' capital expenditures. The definition was expanded in 2017.
