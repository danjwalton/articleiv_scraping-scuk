 Sources: Kosovo authorities; and IMF staff estimates and projections.
 1/ Does not yet reflect the GFSM 2014 methodology.
" 2/ For fiscal rule purposes, IFI and PAK-financed projects post-July 2015 are excluded from the fiscal deficit. In the authorities' presentation, the fiscal rule deficit also excludes expenditures from carried-"
" forward OSR. Following methodology agreed during the SBA, IMF staff assumes no carried-forward OSR."
 3/ The former Yugoslavia debt has been reclassified as a contingent liability and is no longer included in the stock of public debt.
" 4/ Assumes tax compliance gains of 0.7 percent of GDP, a timely and full implementation of the war veteran pension law, and tight administration for all other budgeted social schemes."
" 5/ Based on current legislation, revenue trends, and the 2019 draft Budget. It assumes gains of 0.6 percent of GDP from debt collection and tax compliance which will require implementation of strong"
 reforms in revenue administration.
