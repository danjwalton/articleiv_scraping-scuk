"2.       Following a sharp deceleration in 2017 due to socio-political tensions, the economy"
regained momentum in 2018-19. Robust performance of the export-oriented sectors
"(phosphate extraction, coffee and cocoa, and cotton production), as well as strong activities in"
"the tertiary sector (including at the port and airport), supported the growth recovery. Bank credit"
to the private sector remained broadly flat in 2018. Economic growth is estimated to have
accelerated from 4.4 percent in 2017 to 4.9 percent in 2018. Headline inflation stood at 2 percent
"in March 2019 (year-on-year). Following a significant improvement in 2017, the current account"
deficit increased in 2018 but remained markedly smaller than in previous years. The external
position is broadly consistent with fundamentals and desirable policy settings; Togo has recourse
"to WAEMU’s pooled foreign reserves, equivalent to 4.3 months of union imports at end-2018"
(Annex I).

3.        The fiscal outturn at end-2018 was better than expected (Text Table 1). Total revenue
expanded by 2.1 percentage points of GDP relative to 2017 and was in line with projections.
"Nonetheless, this revenue outturn was partly driven by exceptional revenue (about 1.5 percent of"
"GDP), including ad-hoc collections of disputed tax arrears. Although overall spending increased"
"relative to 2017, it remained significantly below projections, particularly for spending on foreign-"
"financed investment. As a result, the domestic primary balance—which is the fiscal aggregate"
under the control of the government—improved by 1.6 percentage points of GDP from 2017 to
2018 and was in line with projections. The overall primary balance and the overall balance
outperformed targets by large margins. Togo reached the WAEMU fiscal deficit criterion—not
"exceeding 3 percent of GDP—in 2017 and 2018, two years ahead of the timeline agreed by all"
