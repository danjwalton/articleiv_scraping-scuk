10.    The program targets for the primary deficit include adjustors for foreign-financed
project loan disbursements on concessional terms.
""
•     Adjustor for higher than projected foreign-financed project loan disbursements on concessional
      terms. Should the actual disbursement of foreign-financed project loans be above the projections
"      under the program, the primary deficit ceiling will be adjusted upward (higher deficit) by the"
      difference between the actual level and the projected level of disbursements under the program.
      The upward adjustment to the ceiling is capped at the difference between the budget amount
      and the projected level of disbursement. This adjustor means that the program does not
      constrain foreign-financed project loan disbursements on concessional terms.
""
•     Adjustor for lower than projected foreign-financed project loan disbursements on concessional
      terms. Should the actual disbursement of foreign-financed project loans be below the projections
"      under the program, the primary deficit ceiling will be adjusted downward (lower deficit) by the"
      difference between the actual level and the projected level of disbursements under the program.
      This adjustor would align project spending with the actual disbursement of foreign-financed
      project loans on concessional terms.

•     The projections of foreign-financed project loan disbursements for the first 2 test dates are
      presented in Table 5.
