"were updated with the revised statistics published on March 23, 2018."
2/ The entire amount of LETES is recorded under domestic financing given that the market has always been dominated by resident
"investors. However, a relatively small amount of LETES (about 80 million of U.S dollars at end-2017) has been held by foreign"
residents.
